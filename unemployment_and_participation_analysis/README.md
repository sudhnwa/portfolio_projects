<h2>Analyzing Unemployment and participation rates across 51 states of America from 1976 to 2023, collecting data using FRED API.</h2>

The unemployment rate is a key economic indicator, representing the percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment. It is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the total labor force and is often seasonally adjusted for accuracy.

Seasonal adjustment removes seasonal factors' average or anticipated effect from monthly, quarterly, or periodically collected data.
