# Lending Club: Loan Default Prediction

### Data
The Data we will be using is obtained from Kaggle <a>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club</a>

In the data set, there are two CSV files of accepted and rejected loan applications, since we want to predict whether or not the borrower defaults on the loan we will be using only data of accepted loans.

### Our Goal
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we need to build a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan. This way, when getting a new potential customer, we can assess whether or not they are likely to repay the loan.

The "loan_status" column contains our label.
